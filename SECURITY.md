# Security

Our team takes security issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to disseminate your findings responsibly and will make every effort to correct them.

## Reporting Security Issues

To report security problems create an [**issue**](https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop/issues) add the tag **security** and detail to the maximum, of course. We don't have a badly written issues interpreter or just coherent titles.

Thanks
